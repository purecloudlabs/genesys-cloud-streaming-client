# [Unreleased](https://github.com/purecloudlabs/genesys-cloud-streaming-client/compare/v13.2.9...HEAD)
### Added
* [PCM-1715](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1715) - Updated to override how `stanza` currently ends sessions to prevent race condition. Now sending `session-terminate` and if after two seconds the peer connection is still open, manually closing it.

### Fixed
* [PCM-1722](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1722) - Fixed issue where file path in `package.json` did not match the actual built file path and where file path for `module` pointed to a file that did not exist.

# [v13.2.9](https://github.com/purecloudlabs/genesys-cloud-streaming-client/compare/v13.2.8...v13.2.9)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1712](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1712) - Fixed more cases of browser throttling due to setTimeout

### Fixed
* [PCM-1692](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1692) - Bump `async` to `3.2.1` (dep of `stanza`) to fix background tab throttling of WebSocket messages. This is causing webrtc sessions to not connect because `transport-info`s were being throttled.
* [PCM-1701](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1701) - Do not add/use Google STUN servers by default (ie. override `stanza`'s default behavior of adding these to the config).
* [PCM-1529](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1529) - Soft reconnects will actually attempt to connect a WebSocket

# [v13.2.7](https://github.com/purecloudlabs/genesys-cloud-streaming-client/compare/v13.2.6...v13.2.7)

#### Breaking Changes
* In previous versions, calling `acceptRtcSession` on the `webrtcsessions` extension would send both a 'proceed' and 'accept' stanza in one call. This caused race a condition when multiple clients using autoAnswer were open.  They would call `acceptRtcSession` at the same time which sent the other client an 'accept' stanza, resulting in neither client actually handling the incoming session. As a result, we recommend not calling `rtcSessionAccepted` until the session has actually been received.
### Added
* Added a new function `rtcSessionAccepted` to send an 'accept' event
### Changed
* No longer sending 'proceed' and 'accept' in the same call to `acceptRtcSession`
