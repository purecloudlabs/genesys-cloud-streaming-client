# Genesys Cloud Streaming Client (SDK)

The Genesys Cloud Streaming Client serves as the Javascript Web SDK. It handles
establishing and maintaining a websocket connection to the Genesys Cloud streaming
services. This project uses our new XMPP based signaling for real time APIs.

Features:

- [x] PubSub (notifications)
- [ ] WebRTC
    - [x] Softphone
    - [ ] Screen Recording※
    - [ ] Video/Screen Share※
    - [ ] ACD Screen Share※
- [ ] Chat※

\* Coming soon; Until supported in this project, WebRTC softphone applications can be built with
the [Genesys Cloud WebRTC SDK](https://github.com/mypurecloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk).

※ Not yet roadmapped

## Usage

The SDK is based on a simple structure of a core client object with a few properties
and methods, and multiple extensions, each providing their own functionality.

Some extensions are bundled with the client, and others can be added at runtime.
See [Extensions](extensions.md) for details on implementing or adding an extension (or to
  request one be added to core).

After creating an instance of the client, your client can add event handlers for
various events and messages. `connected` and `disconnected`, are examples
of client events. Extensions are also based on event emitters.

## API

###### Behavior notes

- The client will automatically reconnect when possible. Authentication errors are
one example of a disconnect that will not trigger a reconnect.

- The client will emit a `connected` event when the connection is established and
authenticated.

- The websocket host service may periodically request the client reconnect to facilitate connection
draining for a deployment, or load balancing. The client has the ability to delay that reconnect up
to 10 minutes to allow the application to finish any active task which would be disrupted by a reconnect.
To subscribe to this event, use the `requestReconnect` event name, which emits with a callback. The
callback accepts an object with either `pending` or `done` property indicating that the reconnect should
be delayed or can proceed. If the callback is not called within one second, the disconnect will proceed.
If the callback is called with `{ pending: true }` then the disconnect will proceed after the callback
is called with `{ done: true }` or 10 minutes, whichever is sooner. Example:

```js
client.on('requestReconnect', function (callback) {
  // e.g., no calls are alerting
  if (this.canReconnectSafely()) {
    callback({ done: true });
  } else {
    callback({ pending: true });
    // e.g., an event when all calls have disconnected
    this.on('canReconnectSafely', function () {
      callback({ done: true });
    });
  }
});
```

#### Constructor

`new GenesysCloudStreamingClient(options)`

- parameters
  - `Object options` with properties:
    - `String authToken`: Required; access token for the user (not required if using guest authentication JWT)
    - `String host`: Required; `wss://streaming.` + `mypurecloud.com || mypurecloud.ie ||
        mypurecloud.jp || mypurecloud.de || mypurecloud.com.au`
    - `String jid` : Required; JabberId for the user (get from `api/v2/users/me`) (not required if using guest authentication JWT)
    - `String jidResource`: Optional; The identifier that will go into the full jid. The jid will be constructed as {usersBareJid}/{jidResource}. This is helpful for identifying specific clients.
    - `String jwt` : Optional (Required for guest authentication); Json Web Token fetched from public API for acess
        to a particular feature in guest mode (see documentation for Screen Share or Web Chat for details)
    - `Boolean optOutOfWebrtcStatsTelemetry` : Optional; if true, streaming-client will not send webrtc stats to server (packet loss, bitrate, jitter, etc...)
    - `ILogger logger`: Optional; This is a secondary logger to be used in conjuction with the built-in logger for the streaming-client;
    - `LogLevel logLevel`: Optional; Specifies the minimum level of logs that will be sent to the server
    - `LogFormatterFn[] logFormatters`: Optional; see https://github.com/purecloudlabs/genesys-cloud-client-logger#how-formatters-work for more information.
    - `Boolean useServerSidePings`: Optional; If true, streaming-client will request the server to send `ping` stanzas. If false (or unsupported by the server), streaming-client will send `ping` stanzas.

#### Methods

`client.connect() : Promise<void>` - Initialize the WebSocket connection for streaming
connectivity with Genesys Cloud. `connect` must be called before any events will trigger.

`client.reconnect() : Promise<void>` - Disconnect (if connected) and reconnect to
the streaming service

`client.disconnect() : Promise<void>` - Disconnect from the streaming
service

`client.on(eventName, handler) : void` - register an event handler for the client

- parameters
  - `String eventName` - event name to watch
      - Events Supported:
        - 'connected' - when the streaming service is connected AND authenticated
        - 'disconnected' - when the streaming service is disconnected
  - `Function handler` - handler to evoke when event is emitted

`client.once(eventName, handler) : void` - like `on` but handler will be called only once

`client.setAccessToken(token): void` – sets the client's and the logger's access token

#### Extensions

> For details on implementing new extensions, see [extensions.md].

The following extensions are currently bundled with the client:

 - Ping (for keepalive on the socket)
 - Reconnector (for automatic reconnecting)
 - [Notifications](notifications.md)
 - [WebRTC Sessions](webrtc-sessions.md)

## Known Issues and work-arounds

### Axios
We recently updated axios in this library as well as in our dependencies. In the 1.x.x version of axios, they changed the 
module type from CommonJS to ECMAScript. Since Jest runs in a node environment, we need to specify the node version
of axios when testing. This can be done by adjusting the `moduleNameMapper` for jest. If your jest config is in your
`package.json`:
```
"jest": {
  ...
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "axios": "axios/dist/node/axios.cjs"
  }
},
```

or if your config is in a jest.config.js:
```
module.exports = {
  ...
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "axios": "axios/dist/node/axios.cjs"
  },
```
  
NOTE: if you have conflicting versions of axios, you will probably have to specify the axios version present *inside* the streaming-client repo:
```
"moduleNameMapper": {
  "axios": "genesys-cloud-streaming-clinet/node_modules/axios/dist/node/axios.cjs"
}
```

### crypto.getRandomValues()
We recently updated UUID in our dependencies. Starting in V8 of UUID, crypto is required. This is native in the browser and in node, however
Jest runs the *browser* code in *node* environments. Because of this we need to map node's crypto to window.crypto. You can do this by adding
the following to your `setup-tests.ts` file for jest. Also, this is apparently fixed in jest V29 and later.
```
const nodeCrypto = require('crypto');
Object.defineProperty(window, 'crypto', {
  value: {
    getRandomValues: function (buffer: any) {
      return nodeCrypto.randomFillSync(buffer);
    }
  }
});
```
